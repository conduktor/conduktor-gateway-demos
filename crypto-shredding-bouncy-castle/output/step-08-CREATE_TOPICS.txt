[2023-09-19 09:57:17,567] WARN [AdminClient clientId=adminclient-1] Connection to node -2 (localhost/127.0.0.1:7969) terminated during authentication. This may happen due to any of the following reasons: (1) Authentication failed due to invalid credentials with brokers older than 1.0.0, (2) Firewall blocking Kafka TLS traffic (eg it may only allow HTTPS traffic), (3) Transient network issue. (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient)
