      Let's demonstrate field level encryption for third party

      Aka sharing existing data that is not currently encrypted.

      As can be seen from `docker-compose.yaml` the demo environment consists of the following:
      
      * A single Zookeeper Server
      * A main 3 nodes Kafka cluster
      * A 2 nodes Conduktor Gateway server
